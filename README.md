# Commenter
This is a simple app I am build for my personal blog. Right now, [loudcoder.com](loudcoder.com) is only a static blog, and I want
to add a feature to allow posting comments on my blog.

## Architecture

  - comment: for getting comments for a blog and submit a comment
  - echo: a method just for testing
- serverless framework
- DynamoDB

## Tools
We are using several cool tools in this project
- Guava
- Dagger 2
